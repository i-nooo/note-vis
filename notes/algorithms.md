# Algorithms

An algorithm is a finite sequence of well-defined instructions for solving a computational problem or performing a calculation.

## Algorithm Analysis

### Time Complexity

- **O(1)**: Constant time
- **O(log n)**: Logarithmic time
- **O(n)**: Linear time
- **O(n²)**: Quadratic time
- **O(2^n)**: Exponential time

### Space Complexity

- Amount of memory an algorithm uses
- Trade-offs between time and space

## Common Algorithm Types

### Sorting Algorithms

- Bubble Sort: O(n²)
- Merge Sort: O(n log n)
- Quick Sort: O(n log n) average
- Heap Sort: O(n log n)

### Search Algorithms

- Linear Search: O(n)
- Binary Search: O(log n)
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)

### Graph Algorithms

- Dijkstra's shortest path
- Minimum spanning tree
- Topological sorting

## Design Paradigms

- **Divide and Conquer**: Break problem into smaller subproblems
- **Dynamic Programming**: Store solutions to subproblems
- **Greedy**: Make locally optimal choices
- **Backtracking**: Try all possibilities systematically

## Applications
